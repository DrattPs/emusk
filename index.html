                    Wealth
                </h2>
                <p id="paragraph4">
                    At the start of 2020, Musk had a net worth of $27 billion. At the end of the year, his net worth had
                    increased by $150 billion, mostly driven by his ownership of around 20% of Tesla stock. During this
                    period, Musk's net worth was often volatile. For example, it dropped $16.3 billion in September, the
                    largest single-day plunge in Bloomberg Billionaires Index's history. On September 27, 2021, after
                    Tesla
                    stock surged, Forbes announced that Musk had a net worth of over 200 billion USD, and was the
                    richest
                    person in the world.
